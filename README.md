# Terraform AWS VPC and Subnet Configuration

## Overview

This Terraform project sets up an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a specified CIDR block and a subnet within that VPC. It uses Amazon S3 as a backend to store the Terraform state file, ensuring that the infrastructure state is managed consistently across different environments.

## Prerequisites

- **Terraform**: Version 1.9.6 or higher.
- **AWS Account**: An active AWS account with necessary permissions to create VPCs and subnets.
- **AWS CLI**: Optional, but useful for verifying resources after deployment.

## Getting Started

### Configuration

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`
   `cd repo`
Configure Variables: Modify terraform.tfvars to set the CIDR blocks as needed:
vpcCIDR      = "10.0.0.0/16"
subnet1_CIDR = "10.0.1.0/24"

Initialize Terraform:
`terraform init`
Plan Changes: Review the changes Terraform will make:

terraform plan
Apply Changes: Deploy the infrastructure:
`terraform apply`

Destroying Infrastructure
To remove the resources created by Terraform, run:
`terraform destroy`

Outputs
The following outputs are available after the infrastructure is applied:

VPC ID: The ID of the created VPC.
Subnet ID: The ID of the created subnet.
These outputs can be accessed after running terraform apply.

Backend Configuration
The state of your Terraform configuration is managed in an S3 bucket. Ensure that the specified bucket exists and you have permissions to access it. The backend configuration is defined in backend.tf:

hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform.tfstate.bucket"
    key    = "dev1"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

### Tips for Using the README

1. **Replace Placeholder Values**: Make sure to replace `https://github.com/username/repo.git` with the actual URL of your repository.
2. **Add More Details**: If your project includes additional features or configurations, you can expand the README to include those specifics.
3. **Update Regularly**: Keep the README updated as your Terraform configurations evolve or if you add new features. 

This README provides clear guidance on how to use your Terraform project, making it easier for others to understand and utilize your code.
